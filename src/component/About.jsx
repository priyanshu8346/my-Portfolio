            <p className=' font-semibold'>I am a highly motivated and results-oriented final year student at IIEST Shibpur with a passion for technology and problem-solving. I possess a strong foundation in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and have honed my problem-solving skills by successfully tackling over 700 Data Structures and Algorithms problems.

Beyond my technical expertise, I am an active and enthusiastic individual with a proven track record of leadership and organizational skills. I have played a key role as an event manager in Rebeca, IIEST Shibpur's cultural fest, and as a joint coordinator in Sphuran, the electrical engineering department fest. I have also volunteered extensively across various departments, demonstrating my ability to take on challenges and work effectively in collaborative environments.

            <p className=' font-semibold'>To showcase my skills and accomplishments, I have created this portfolio website that highlights my projects, experiences, and technical proficiency. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges and contribute to meaningful projects.</p>
